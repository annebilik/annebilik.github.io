		<h2> About Me </h2>	
		<p> My name is Anne Bilik. I'm from a small town in northern Illinois. Growing up I did dance, mostly ballet, for 10 years. In high school I did soccer. I am a junior here at the University of South Carolina. I am majoring in biological sciences and working on a minor in business administration. I always wanted to go to college somewhere warmer than Illinois and when I visited here I knew I wanted to go here.</p>

	<p id="txt" class="hidden"> Besides school, there are a few other things I like to spend my time doing. I like to do yoga and travel when I can. This summer my family is planning to go to Italy for a week so I'm very excited about that. I also like to paint and hangout with my friends. </p>

		<h2> My Future Career Plans </h2>	
		<p> To be completely honest I am still not set on a career path as of now. However, I do have a few options that sound interesting to me. One career path I am interested in is development of food, beverages, or supplements. This is very interesting to me in general and I like that I could aid in the development of something that could be seen in the market. </p>
	<a id="mores" href="#" onclick="showMores()"> Show More... </a>
		<p id="txts" class="hidden"> Another career path being research. I think the idea of doing research sounds appealing. I do like research and labs, and I think that research would be a good field to be in because the findings have the opportunity to help everyone. However, I would most likely have to continue on with schooling to get an advanced degree. </P>
